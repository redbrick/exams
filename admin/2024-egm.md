## Practical Section [144]

> [!NOTE] 
> Please include a brief summary of the steps you took to complete each question

### 1. Security [12]

1. Secure your vm to your best ability

> There are many ways to accomplish this, the best approach is a well-rounded holistic one

### 2. DNS [25]

> If you get stuck here, don't worry, come back to it later

1. Install a DNS server of your choice on your vm
2. Make it the authoritative DNS server for your vm's domain `*.<username>-vm` and add A records for `web.<username>-vm` and `ldap.<username>-vm`

### 3. LDAP [25]

1. Install an LDAP server on your vm
2. Set up an LDAP server
	- Use `o=redbrick` for the organisation.
	- Create organisation units groups and users
	- Create an LDAP user called `morpeus` under the organisational unit `users`. Use the following credentials for them.

```
user: morpheus
password: the password to your VM
home: /home/morpheus
shell: /bin/bash
```

3. Allow `morpheus` to login over SSH through LDAP
	- This means LDAP user `morpheus` should be able to log into your VM via `ssh morpheus@$your-vm` with their password. They shouldn't need a local account to do this.
    - Their home directory should be created upon login if it does not exist.

### 4. File Share [10]

1. Set up your vm to provide storage over the network
2. mount this file share to your local machine and transfer some files
	- send proof of this (screenshot etc.)

### 5. Database [12]

1. Setup a standalone database for your applications to connect to - *you will be judged by the database you choose*
2. Create a user called `habibi`
3. Leave a special message for the admins and grant `habibi` access to it
4. Backup this database to a file.

### 6. Docker [25]

1. Install docker on your vm
2. Set up [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) in a docker container and connect it to a sensible database - *or don't?*
	- any and all HedgeDoc data should be persistent
3. Grab the logs from the HedgeDoc container and paste them here.
4. Set up a reverse proxy of your choice in a docker container and connect it to HedgeDoc *(for full marks a self signed cert is expected here, no more than that is needed)*
5. Set up HedgeDoc to use LDAP for auth
	- User `morpheus` should be able to login with their username and password

### 7. Nomad [15]

1. Install Nomad on your vm
2. Set up a single-node nomad deployment on your vm
3. Deploy an nginx web server using nomad serving static content
4. Use the reverse proxy you set up earlier to proxy this *(any valid way of achieving this is okay)*

### 8. Scripts [20]

1. Write a cron job to cleanup dangling docker containers and images every 24 hours at midnight
2. Write a script that searches a directory for files containing a string from `$1`
3. Write a script (service) to auto-mount block devices. This should run in the background and not be attached to a specific tty.
4. Write a fun script that will amuse us
