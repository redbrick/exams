Admin Exam
===

## Practical (80 marks)

Login details:

```
Hostname:
Username:
Password:
```

Please explain roughly what you did under each section, and make sure to include any commands that you think are important. I don't want to read 4 pages of `cd $dir; ls -l`

Note that you have to get at least 40% in each section to pass. It doesn't matter what you get overall.

### Security (10 marks)

1. Secure your VM.
    a. This is open-ended. Interpret "secure" however you would like.

### Databases (5 marks)

1. Set up a Postgresql server.
3. Create a user for `meow` using the password given to you, and allow them to access the database server remotely.
5. Import the database dump provided to you, and grant all privileges `meow` on the imported tables.

### Monitoring (10 marks)

*Place the answer to part 3 of this section in `/root/prometheus`.*

1. Set up a Prometheus server.
3. Set up a Prometheus node exporter that sends data to the Prometheus server.
    a. NB: this might already be done for you by the package manager.
1. Write a query to compute the rate of change of used disk space over a 5 minute window.

### LDAP (25 marks)

1. Install an LDAP server, use `o=redbrick` for the organisation.
3. Create the organizational units "groups" and "users".
5. Create an LDAP user under the organizational unit "users". Use the following details for them:
    ```
    Username: meow
    Password: the same as the one you were given
    Home: /home/meow
    Shell: /bin/bash
    ```
1. Allow SSH authentication through LDAP.
    1. This means that the LDAP user `meow` should be able to log in via `ssh meow@$your-vm` with their password. They should not need a local account to do this.
    1. Their home directory should be automatically created.
    1. There's a load of weird inconsistencies with `chsh` and LDAP. You can just ignore `chsh`, it doesn't matter if it won't work on LDAP accounts.

### Web Services (15 marks)

1. Install a HTTP server.
    It doesn't matter which one you pick, just make sure it's not a buggy piece of shit.
1. Make `http://$your-vm/index.html` a page containing just the phrase "Hello, world!".
3. Set up SSL for your HTTP server via LetsEncrypt.
5. Set up a userdir system. The web directory for each user should be located at `$HOME/public_html`.
    Userdir just means that the directory `/home/$user/public_html` should be accessible at `http://$your-vm/~$user/`.

### Scripting (15 marks)

*Place the answers to this section in `/root/scripts`. You can implement them in any language of your choice.*

1. Write a script that prints out the names of all users who are using more than 5G of disk space.
    1. You can assume that all of their files are located in their home directory.
1. Write a script to print out the names of all users who have a file named `infected.html` created within the past 5 minutes in their web directory.
1. Alter the previous script to instead prevent them from logging in (be as creative as you wish!).

### E-mail

We aren't that evil.

## Paper (20 marks)

### Redbrick (5 marks)

1. How many machines does Redbrick have? What are their names?
3. A user has hit their disk quota and wants an increase. Where is this configured?
5. How can users report inappropriate content hosted on Redbrick?

### Networking (5 marks)

1. Why do IP addresses exist? Why is it not sufficient to just use MAC addresses?
3. How can you check if an IP is being used by another host without using ping?
4. What should you consider when changing DNS records? (Provide as much detail as you like)

### File Systems (5 marks)
1. What happens under the hood when you run the `rm` command? Assume the file system is ext4.
3. Why is the name of a file not located in the inode? (It shouldn't make a difference, but assume that the file system is ext4.)
5. Why can you not hard link to a file on a different file system?

### Miscellaneous (5 marks)
1. Somebody ran the following command with an account that can gain root:
    ```sudo chown user:user -R /home/user /*```
    What happens when this occurs? What errors might appear? (Do not run it on your VM. Please.)
1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how big is Kyle's head?
3. Write (or find...) a program that will break us.
