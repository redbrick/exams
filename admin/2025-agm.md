## Practical Section [125]

> [!NOTE]
> Please include a brief summary of the steps you took to complete each question. Provide photo's when necessary.
> You MUST follow admin instruction for the duration of the exam. Failure to do so may lead to your your disqualification.

### 1. Security [15]

1. Secure your vm to your best ability

> There are many ways to accomplish this, the best approach is a well-rounded holistic one

### 2. LDAP [25]

1. Install an LDAP server on your VM
2. Set up an LDAP server
	- Use `o=blueblock` for the organisation.
	- Create organisation units `groups` and `accounts`
	- Create an LDAP user called `neo` under the organisational unit `accounts`. Use the following credentials for them.

```
user: neo
password: the password to your VM
home: /home/neo
shell: /bin/bash
```

3. Allow `neo` to login over SSH through LDAP
	- This means LDAP user `neo` should be able to log into your VM via `ssh neo@$your-vm` with their password. They shouldn't need a local account to do this.
    - Their home directory should be created upon login if it does not exist.

4. Add neo to a Brickies group
    - Create a `brickies` group in the LDAP
    - Add `neo` to this group

5. Add a gecos for neo
    - Add a gecos attribute for `neo` with his real name

### 3. File Share [10]

1. Set up your VM to provide storage over the network
2. Mount this file share to your local machine and transfer some files
	- Send proof of this (screenshot etc.)

### 4. Database [15]

1. Setup a standalone database for your applications to connect to - *you will be judged by the database you choose*
2. Create a user called `goombean`
3. Leave a special message for the admins and grant `goombean` access to it
4. Backup this database to a file. Paste the path to the file here:

```
```

### 5. Docker [25]

1. Install docker on your vm
2. Set up [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) in a docker container and connect it to a sensible database - *or don't?*
	- any and all HedgeDoc data should be persistent
3. Grab the logs from the HedgeDoc container and paste them here.

```
```

4. Set up a reverse proxy of your choice in a docker container and connect it to HedgeDoc
5. Set up HedgeDoc to use LDAP for auth
	- User `neo` should be able to login with their username and password

### 6. Nomad [15]

1. Install Nomad on your vm
2. Set up a single-node nomad deployment on your vm
3. Deploy an nginx web server using nomad serving static content
4. Proxy this web server through the reverse proxy you set up earlier *(any valid way of achieving this is okay)*
5. Write a script to display all nomad allocations and save their logs to a file. *(Do **NOT** use the web GUI)*

### 7. Scripts [20]

1. Write a cron job to update a git repository with new changes every day

```

```

2. Write cron job to backup all the files on the file share and backup the database

```

```

3. Write a script that updates an LDAP user's password with a randomly generated password

```

```

4. Due to `ayden`'s massive *"homework"* collection `/home` has been completely filled up. Write a script to find the top 10 largest files in `/home`, display them to the user and should the user accept it, delete them.

```

```

5. The admins can never seem to keep their docs up to date. Write a script that will alert them if any file in their git repo is more than 6 months out of date.

```

```

6. Write a fun script that will amuse us

```

```
