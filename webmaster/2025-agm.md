## Practical (60 marks)

### Set Up Git Repository

* Create a private repository on GitHub.
* Give `@novanai` collaborator access to the repository.

### Set Up Project Structure

* Create a directory called `site`.
* Work within the `site` directory for the frontend development.

### Create Hoodie Purchase Form

1. Create a simple HTML form with the following input fields:
    * Username
    * Hoodie Colour (Black/White)
    * Size (XS/S/M/L/XL)
    * Amount
2. Apply styling to the fields:
    * Drop shadows
    * Rounded corners
    * Border colour change on focus
3. Add an image above the form displaying a hoodie based on the `Colour` field.
4. Validate the following fields on form submission:
    * Username:
        * Input is 3-8 characters in length.
        * Contains only alphanumeric characters.
        * Is all lowercase
    * Amount:
        * Input is a number.
        * Input is within the range 1-5.

### Set Up Development Server

* Include a simple dev server to locally serve the static files.
* You can use [Vite](https://vite.dev/), a bundler, or a static site generator for this.

### Set Up API Service

* In the root directory, create a directory called `api`.
* Work within the `api` directory for the backend development.
* Create a simple RESTful API using [Express](https://expressjs.com/fast), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), or another tool of your choice.
* Add a `POST /hoodies` endpoint to accept the form data and respond with a rendered HTML page containing the order confirmation.

> [!NOTE] Styling is optional for this part, and will give no extra marks.

### Connect Frontend to Backend

* Edit the form in the `site` directory to send the HTTP request to the API which renders the page response accordingly.

### Push to GitHub

* Commit and push all the changes to the GitHub repository.
